# GCT-Scioly-EV

This project is my attempt at an Electric Vehicle for Science Olympiad.
In the Electric Vehicle Competition, a vehicle must be powered by 8AA batteries and must get to the end point.
The endpoint can be between 7-10 meters away, and the accuracy has to be down to the cm.
The vehicle also has to do this in a certain amount of time, which is given on the day of the competition. The closer it is to the time, the better.
Lastly, for bonus points, the vehicle must be able to curve. The event judge will place a water bottle down, and you can place a water bottle next to it. Then, the vehicle has to curve between the two bottles and still go to the endpoint as accurately as possible, with concern for time and distance, but the bonus points help your score.


For my attempt, I want to use 2 motors at the back of the vehicle, with 2 wheels. 
Both motors will have encoders on them to track distance. 
I also want to try to use PID to increase the accuracy,
My goal is to cut the weight of the vehicle as much as possible and to make it as simple as possible.
